# Dear Rajiv,

I write to you, with a loose resemblance to [S. Ramanujan reaching out to G.H. Hardy][ramanujan], to exchange thoughts on the impending risks of asynchronicity of our social system with the digital systems that are rapidly digitizing human experiences<sup id="f1">[`1`](#1)</sup>.  Unlike the great Ramanujan, I am just an average person with an average story, and have only ideas and nothing concrete to offer; However, I find myself in a situation very similar to Ramanujan, of a pressing need to share the ideas in this letter.  This letter is authored in the form of an open and public weblink, and is based on raw thoughts that coalesced over a 6-hour roadtrip travelling from the Bay Area to SoCal, and I hope that the unpolished prose present these ideas honestly to you.

## Infra

This section defines the fundamental concepts that will be used in this letter.

### Systems

Whether we realize it, we all live and are constantly interacting with systems (e.g. ecosystem, body system, solar system, social system etc).

> ***System***: a set of entities, real or abstract, comprising a whole.

The following abstract systems are unofficially defined for purposes of effectively communicating ideas in this letter:

> ***Natural system***: the physical system that we live and interact in.

> ***Digital system***: the system of software/hardware/network components that we created in the last century.

> ***Social system***: a system of human beings and their social interactions as individuals and groups.

With these specific definitions, we note a few properties of the relationships between these systems:
- The natural system and digital system can be defined without the need for people and societies.
- The social system requires the existence of people for it to be meaningfully defined.<sup id="f2">[`2`](#2)</sup>
- We live in the natural system.
  - Our social system has adapted and evolved with the natural system for thousands of years.
  - For most parts, we have evolved with the natural system, and are surviving because we are *synchronous* with it.
- We *created* digital systems in the last century.
  - Just as we have evolved with the natural system, we are evolving with the digital systems we create.
  - Our social system is increasingly dependent on these digital systems.
  - Digital systems are now capable of creating more digital systems (i.e. artifical intelligence and automation).
  - While digital systems have empowered the modern human to live better lives, there is a growing asynchronous gap between our social system and digital systems, to which further sections in this letter hopes to elaborate.

### Synchronicity

We provide a simple and narrow definition of synchronicity:

> ***Synchronicity***: a measure of how events and systems relate with each other.

When events and systems relate well and are in harmony (for lack of a better word) with each other, we describe them as being *synchronous*, and when the relationships and connections become increasingly unrelated and conflicting, we decribe them as being *asynchronous*.<sup id="f3">[`3`](#3)</sup>

## The Digital Social System

Over the last decade, Facebook and many social-media companies took their approach on digitizing social systems.  We will refer to such a system as a *digital social system*.

The current digital social system is largely connected.  This connection is easily evident through an analysis of the underlying digital systems.  We have built enormous computing infrastructure that manage large social graphs and their complex interactions with ecosystems of other digital systems.  When analyzed as a social system, we also recognize that we are increasing social connections in various ways.  We are able to connect, share ideas, and express ourselves in a digital medium that transcends physical limitations.

Yet, the digital social system feels more like a digital system, and less like a social system.  The main reason for this is the restrictive interfaces that prevent people from expressing themselves naturally.  For example,
- The current digital social system encourages "recommendation over discovery".  Instead of discovering and sharing ideas ourselves, we unknowingly rely and share recommendations generated from non-human algorithms that are usually optimized on metrics that are not directly relatable to the sharing process.
- As digital systems evolve and automate creation of other digital systems (both data, accounts, and services), we increasingly face the problem of authenticity of knowledge (i.e. fake news).

It is clear that digital systems are evolving and adapting synchronously with each other, as mentioned in our analysis of the digital social system as a digital system.  However, our social system has become increasingly asynchronous with the digital systems that we built, which ironically, were created to solve human social problems.  Taking the challenging problem of mitigating fake news as a case study, social-media companies are able to address this with digital systems via algorithms and machine learning, but the open problem remains that people are still unable to make a judgment without the aid of digital systems.  At this point, we should reflect on the question:

> Have we actually created a solution to human problems or have we simply created more digital systems that can solve the problems but unable to relate back to the human experience of the problem, and therefore unknowingly continue to widen the synchronicity gap of our social system and digital systems?


## Tandem

[Tandem] brands itself as,

> The virtual office for remote teams.

When I first used Tandem, there was something unique about it that I cannot exactly pinpoint.  Immediate feelings were *fun*, *delightful* and *cute*, but upon recent insights when writing this letter, I realized it was because

> Tandem focuses on being *people-first*.

The choice of words in "*people-first*" is intentional.  While most companies do their best to be *people-focused*, it still seems that a balanced tradeoff of market/technology/implementation drives the decision-making process.  I am not saying that Tandem magically escapes this decision-making process, but there is an energy in the product that reflects the intentional focus on being *people-first* (much like the Jobs-era Apple).

Tandem will be "yet-another-software" product if they did not focus on being *people-first*.  When using Tandem, technology implementation details and concepts are pushed as far back in the scenes as possible, allowing humans to connect virtually in the most natural way possible.

Tandem's product, to put simply, is about people, and a trust in people to use the software as a *secondary* means to solve *primary* human problems.  It provides no opinionated solutions nor recommendations, and an emphasis on empowering humans virtually seems to be a subtle but important factor in improving the synchronicity of human interactions with digital systems.

## A New Social~~-media~~ Web

It is exciting to see what a new social web would look like.  Let's close our eyes, pause a little, and simply -- imagine.

Imagine a social web that:
- is *people-first* and technology-second.
- increases human and social interactions in natural ways.
- is mindful about the synchronicity of social systems with digital systems.
- is invisible because people are just interacting naturally.
- understands that only humans are capable of truly solving human problems.

Tandem and many other products that are mindful about this problem, provides hope to the current impending risks of asynchronicity of our social system and digital systems, by recognizing and emphasizing that at the heart of every problem, the only meaningful solutions are solved by the social collaboration of groups of people.

Because, we are fundamentally after all,

> *A system of social beings discovering, learning, struggling, sharing, and adapting in a world of systems, without ever losing the meaning of what it means to be **social**.*

[Dear Rajiv](#dear-rajiv), whether this letter reaches you, or connects with you is of secondary importance.  I am *thankful* for a chance encounter with [Tandem] that helped me realize that I have always been on the path of understanding and bridging human experiences in an increasingly digitized world, and renewing my confidence that many other people are tackling this existential problem we face.  I still look forward to connecting, in a *physical* way, with you if the opportunity is available.

A stranger in a highly connected yet increasingly asynchronous world,

Yours truly,

Chris Zhou

- <span id="3">`3`</span>: I am unfamiliar with the official origin and use of the terms *synchronous* and *asynchronous* in relation to the subject matter of social systems, but I will accredit them to [Tandem], from which I was first exposed to the terminology.[⏎](#f3)
